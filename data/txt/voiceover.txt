"In a world where equations come to life... there exists an extraordinary young man, Max.

Max, played by Timothée Chalamet, is no ordinary scientist. His experiments defy the ordinary, boldly wander into the strange, and occasionally, become magical.

With analog computers and whimsical algorithms, Max teams up with the peculiar yet brilliant Professor Anderson, portrayed by Bill Murray.

Their journey through the enigmatic realms of MATLAB and Simulink unfolds in a symphony of colorful chaos, eclectic technologies, and serendipitous discoveries.

A journey where each computation sparks a revelation, every calculation a wonder.

From the visionary mind of Wes Anderson comes 'MATLAB and Simulink: The Symphony of Imagination'— pulling the strings of reason, and plucking the notes of creativity."
