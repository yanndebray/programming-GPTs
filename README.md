In this repo, you will learn how to program GPTs primarily leveraging OpenAI’s APIs. If you don’t know what an API is (Application Programming Interface), then this is not the repo you’re looking for. Go look it up on the internet, and come back after learning some basics of programming, preferably in Python, as this will be the language used for the tutorials in each chapter.
Generative Pre-Trained Transformers are quite complicated general-purpose machines that can do a lot of different things, like handling sequences of text, images, and sounds. You will learn the basic concepts and principles behind GPTs, and how they work under the hood. But more importantly, you will learn how to integrate them inside of your applications.

The repo is divided into 10 chapters, each covering a different topic and a different aspect of programming GPTs. The chapters are:
- **Chapter 1: 🤖 Introducing GPTs.** How they work and their evolution. 

- **Chapter 2: 🐱💬 OpenAI APIs.** In this chapter, you will learn how to use the OpenAI APIs, a simple way to create AI agents with GPT Models. You will start by learning how to create your own chatbot.

- **Chapter 3: 🔗 Prompting, Chaining & Summarization.** In this chapter, you will learn how to engineer prompts, chain calls to a Large Language Model and use it to summarize texts, such as articles, books, or transcripts. You will use the OpenAI API together with the LangChain package to enhance GPTs.

- **Chapter 5: 🕵️‍♀️🛠️ Agent & Tools.** In this chapter, you will learn to build an Agent, called Smith, that has access to tools, such as getting the current weather. You will also learn how to use the Assistant API provided by OpenAI, and to extend their capabilities with tools to integrate GPTs with external services. This will be illustrated with the implementation of your own Code Interpreter, that can help you write and run code with GPTs.
